# 🚗 Car Lease Agreement Analyzer

An AI-Powered System for Automated Car Lease Contract Analysis and Intelligent Negotiation Support

Built as part of **Infosys Springboard AI Domain Internship**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

When a person goes to buy or lease a car, the dealer provides a contract with many pages of complex legal language. Most people do not understand terms like APR, money factor, residual value, cap cost, disposition fee or early termination charges. They sign the contract without fully understanding what they are agreeing to. This leads to:

- **Hidden fees** — Unexpected charges like mileage overage fees and disposition fees that people never notice
- **Inadequate transparency** — Critical clauses like arbitration terms and default conditions buried in dense legal text
- **Ambiguous language** — Complex legal jargon that a common person cannot understand
- **Poor financial decisions** — Signing unfair contracts without knowing the actual risks and obligations

---

## ✅ Our Approach

Our system solves this problem by allowing users to upload any car lease or loan contract document and receive a complete AI-powered analysis within 30 seconds.

The approach follows a 6-step pipeline:

1. **Document Upload** — User uploads PDF, scanned image or text file through the web application
2. **OCR Processing** — PyMuPDF extracts text from digital PDFs, Tesseract OCR handles scanned documents and images
3. **AI Extraction** — Google Gemini 2.5 Flash reads the raw text and extracts 25+ structured fields from the contract
4. **Decision Logic** — System calculates fairness score from 0 to 100, identifies red flags and generates negotiation suggestions
5. **VIN Verification** — NHTSA government API validates vehicle details and checks active safety recalls
6. **Results and Chatbot** — Complete analysis displayed on dashboard with AI chatbot ready for follow-up questions

### Step 2 — Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip uninstall bcrypt -y
pip install bcrypt==4.0.1
```

### Step 3 — Create Environment File
